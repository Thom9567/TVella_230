This is the website for Thomas Vella, an undergraduate at Bucknell Univeristy. 

I am a current senior at Bucknell University and I am anticipated to graduate this December with a Bachelors of Science degree in Statistics.

I am from Long Island, New York, and have a proclivity for sports analytics, primarily in the fields of football and baseball, the latter of which you will see soon enough. 

My data story will focus on my relationship with Major League Baseball, particularly that of the team I root for. This data visualization story is representative of something personal to me.
