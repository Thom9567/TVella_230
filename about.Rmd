This is the website for Thomas Vella, an undergraduate at Bucknell Univeristy. 

I am currently majoring in the mathematics department seeking a Bachelors of Science in Statistics. I am set to graduate next fall.

I am from Long Island, New York, and have a proclivity for New York Sports teams, as you will see soon enough. 

My data story will focus on my relationship with Major League Baseball, particularly that of the team I root for. This data visualization story is representative of something personal to me.
