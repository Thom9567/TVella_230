      "contents": "\nYou could call me a late bloomer when it comes to baseball. I played\nit as a kid up until about the 5th grade before I got more involved with\nother sports; I never really enjoyed or cared much for the game until I\nwas much older. I was re-intoduced to baseball rather reluctantly\nthrough my friends, notably after years of trying to blow them and the\nsport off. When I did inevitably revisit it, I had a new-found sense of\nappreciation for the game, and after a lot of deliberation/persuasion\nfrom my Met and Yankee friends, I decided to lock myself in as a Met\nfan. This was in the 2018, my senior year of high school. Despite only\ndiligently watching the Mets for the better half of 4 seasons, I have\nwitnessed an obscene amount of horror and heartbreak that I think could\nbe nicely summarized through the use of data visualizations. The sheer\nimprobability of the events that we will discuss in this piece have\nacted as sort of therapeutic remedy for me, and I hope that you too will\nderive some enjoyment out of this personal project.\nThis will focus primarily on two major Metropolitan events that I\nhave experienced firsthand since rejoining the world of baseball. The\nnature of these two events are rather different in terms of what they\ndescribe, but are unified in the fact that they somehow both happened to\nthe mets in teh short span of 3 years. The first major event we will\ndiscuss will be the most recent of the two, that being the story of the\n2020 Mets.\nThe 2020 Mets\nAs we are all too well aware of by now, 2020 was an extremely\ndifficult and strange year for all of us; major league baseball was no\ndifferent. Let’s first set the scene: Due to Covid-19 and some other\ncollective bargaining issues, as opposed to playing a normal 162 regular\nseason game schedule, the league opted to instead play 60. By reducing\nthe regular season to about 37% of its normal length, this obviously\nmeant that teams would not be given the chance to recover from a slow\nstart. The league recognized this and their response was to change the\nplayoff format to something completely unprecedented and likely never to\nreturn: they were extremely lenient and allowed over half the league to\nqualify for the playoffs that year (16/30 teams). Baseball is notorious\nfor having very small playoff fields, which is something that we will\nlater touch on, and this one season remedy appeared to be fair enough\nfor what the individual teams had been given.\nThat idea, and the assumption that the 2020 season wouldn’t produce\nsuch wild results given the leagues accomodations, proved to be\nunequivocally false, and the 2020 Mets are the leading reason as to why.\nThe Mets led MLB in batting average, were second in on-base percentage,\nand were fourth in slugging (total bases per at bat) percentage. By\nnearly any metric, they were an elite offense. These metrics can be\nnicely summarized by a statistic called “Weighted Runs Created”, which\nessentially boils down to how many runs a team created through their\noffensive output. Every outcome at the plate has a specific run value\nassociated with it: if you hit a double, then you have “created” some\nlevel of scoring for your team, whether or not that single event\nactually results in anything tangible on the scoreboard. The same can be\nsaid for negative outcomes such as strikeouts, by doing so you have hurt\nyour teams ability to score and have “created” an opportunity to score\nless. Weighted Runs Created, WRC, is a very powerful stat for this\nreason; it gives a much better indicication of how good an offense\nactually is over how many runs they actually score, and is directly\ncalculated using the team batting statistics that I noted the Mets led\nthe league in earlier, those being batting average, on base percentage,\nand slugging percentage. Therefore, it makes sense that the 2020 Mets\nled all of major league baseball in runs created.\nSomething worth noting about Weighted Runs Created is that it is a\ncumulative statistic; the more games you play the higher the value would\nbe. This means that the worst offense in the 2019 season would register\na higher WRC than the 2020 Mets simply because they have played more\ngames. Therefore we need a new stat that will allow us to compare across\ndifferent seasons and perhaps even different eras, which is exactly what\nWRC+ does. As opposed to calculating the efficiency of an offense\ncumulatively, WRC+ compares their statistics across the other teams\nplaying that year, and spits out a number to quantify how good they were\nfor that season of play. The way this statistic works is very different\nthan other traditional statistics. In the realm of WRC+, since it is a\ncomparative statistic that is quantifying for that specific year, it is\ncalculated in such a way that a score of 100 is league average and\nanything above or below represents the percentage difference they are\nfrom league average. For example, a WRC+ rating of 150 means that this\nspecific player or team was a 50% better hitter than league average,\nwhile a rating of 75 means that this player/team was 25% worse than\nleague average.\nWRC+ therefore allows us to quantify how good the 2020 Mets were at\nhitting against teams from other years and even completely different\neras of baseball. The 2020 Mets had a team WRC+ of 123, which is the\nfifth highest measure of all time! They were not only good for the 2020\nseason, but they were supposedly one of the best offenses of all time.\nIf it hasn’t been painfully clear where this has been going yet, let me\nget to the punchline: The 2020 Mets did not produce the way they were\nsupposed to offensively. In matter of fact, despite having what\nshould’ve been the 5th best offense in the history of baseball, they\nmissed the playoffs in a year in which over the half the league\nqualified. Let’s take a look at our first graph representing this\ntradegy, which is a scatterplot showing WRC+ and Actual Runs scored for\nthe 2020 season.\n\n\n\nCan you figure out which point is the Mets? You may look at this\ngraph and think to yourself why is it that WRC+ seems to do a worse job\npredicting the actual Runs scored of teams with exceptionally high WRC+\nscores? Is it possible that its predictive value begins to break down as\nwe reach more and more potent offenses? The answer is no. The reasoning\nbehind this comes from the fact that the Mets represent such an extreme\noutlier that they are greatly warping the line of best fit. Let’s take a\nlook at what the data looks like when we remove the Mets from our\nanalysis.\n\n\n\nYou are hopefully looking at this as dumbfounded as I first was. How\ncould it be that such a powerful offense, one that was tasked at\ncreating runs at a historic level, fail to actually score runs? The\nreasoning, outside of the Mets being the Mets, comes from the a\nshortfall in the way WRC+ is calculated that is often never a problem\nbut was perhaps exacerbated by the significantly shortened season; that\nproblem being sequencing.\nConsider the following scenario: When a team goes up to bat,they draw\na walk, hit a single, and hit a home run before the inning is ended.\nThese facts alone cannot tell you how many runs the team scored. The\nsequence of events here matter. If the home run happens first, only 1\nrun will score, but if the walk and single happen prior to the home run\nthen 3 runs will score. WRC and WRC+ have proven to be good measures of\noffensive production since their inception, so its more than possible\nthat sequencing would’ve played a larger impact here. With that being\nsaid, this doesn’t make the Mets infallible. The 2020 Mets as a team\npreformed considerably worse with runners in scoring position, that\nbeing a player on second or third base. Their triple slash, which again\nled the league over the course of the season at .272/.348/.459 (batting\naverage/on-base percentage/slugging percentage) fell to .245/.328/.406\nwith runners in scoring position and to a pathetic .224/.310/344 in\nscoring circumstances with 2 outs. This can effectively account for the\nsequencing issue, but this paints a much different picture; the Mets\nwere so unbelievably good at hitting when the bases were empty but\nbecame inexplicably much worse when the the bases had action. This is\nhistorically not the case; pitchers are at a disadvantage in scenarios\nwhere the bases aren’t empty. The Mets were simply so much worse in\nclutch hitting scenarios that every inning felt like a “bad sequence”,\nwhen in reality it was just the way the team functioned. It is\nimprobable and inexplicable, but also doesn’t paint a full picture as to\nwhy the 2020 Mets failed to live up to their expectations.\nDespite their struggles to live up to the hype, the Mets offense was\nin the top half of the league in terms of actual runs scored. Another\nthing you may be thinking about at this point is how good, or really how\nbad, the Mets pitching must have been to keep them out an expanded\nplayoff field. Their pitching staff wasn’t spectacular, but it wasn’t\nhorrible either. One of my favorite equations as it relates to baseball\nin the Pythagorean Expectation formula, which gives an expected winning\npercentage of a team by using just the runs they scored and the runs\nthey allowed. This allows us to play the game of seeing where the 2020\nMets would’ve ended up if their offense met expectations, if we replace\nactual runs scored with weighted runs created. Would they have made the\nplayoffs, or was their pitching so bad that it isn’t even worth\ndiscussing? I’m sure you already know the answer by now, but check out\nthe graph of each team with their actual wins plotted against their\nexpected wins when we replace their actual runs scored with their\nweighted runs created. The Mets again under-preformed by the widest\nmargin, and would’ve made the cut.\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"visdat\":{\"e85d848a92\":[\"function ()

I mentioned how Weighted Runs Created + allows us to compare\noffenses from all kinds of different ERAs and how the 2020 Mets were\nsupposedly the 5th greatest of all time. This got me wondering: how did\nthe top 100 offenses preform each year? Did they make the playoffs in\ntheir respective seasons and if so did they win a World Series? How\nabout whether or not any other top 100 offensive team would’ve missed\nthe playoffs for their season if they were given the same luxuries as\nthe 2020 Mets, where being in the top half of the league would’ve been\nenough to qualify? The following alluvial plot shows just that, where\neach team is initially seperated by league.\n\n\n\nI found this to be absolutely astonishing. Of the top 100 offenses,\nonly 3 would have been able to not qualify in the 2020 playoffs. The 5th\nranked 2020 Mets, the 71st ranked San Fransisco Giants, and the 97th\nranked Texas Rangers.\nThe 71st ranked Giants were also a 2020 team, but they had a\nconsiderably worse pitching staff and missed the playoffs by a\ntiebreaker to the Milwaukee Brewers. Their expected Pythagorean Wins was\nonly 3 higher than what they actually achieved (as seen in the earlier\ngraph). Sure this was a major disapointment, but it pales in comparison\nto that of the 2020 Mets.\nThe other team, the 97th ranked Texas Rangers, are the only team on\nthis list to play in a full season, that being 2008. Their offense lived\nup to the billing, but their pitching staff was far and away the worst\nin the major leagues that year; in matter of fact it was so bad that it\nactually negated the potency of their offense, which makes this result\nunsuprising.\nTo further specifiy, of other top 99 offenses of all time, 97 of them\nwould’ve qualified for the Mets postseason, 72 would’ve qualified for\nthe postseason in their own era, notably in some of which only two teams\nmade it, and 24 won a World Series. It’s hard to call the 2020 Mets\nseason anything short of an absolute failure when looked at in\ncomparison to other offenses of even remote caliber.\nDegrom\nThe second moment I wanted to share and discuss doesn’t require such\na grand introduction as the 2020 Mets. This takes place two years prior,\nin the 2018 season, in a normal year of baseball, which I’m still unsure\nmakes this better or worse.\nOne of the major reasons I chose this case study, other from the\nfacts that it too is completely inexplicable and happened to the Mets,\nis how nicely it looks juxtaposed to the misery of the 2020 Mets; they\nreally are just two different ways of telling the same story.\nIn 2018, Jacob DeGrom had a historic season for a starting pitcher,\nand perhaps undeniably the best individual season of any starting\npitcher over the past 5 years. There are many stats in baseball that can\ntell you how good a pitcher is, which we will see in not too long, but\nthe one that matter most is “Earned Run Average”, or ERA for short. It\nisn’t a stat that relies on any sort of inference or expected outcome\nsuch as WRC and WRC+; its simply a count of how many runs said pitcher\nlet up that he was responsible for. What constitutes responsible is\nreally not worth discussing in this analysis, but let me preface by\nsaying the overwhelming majority of runs scored in an MLB season fall\nunder the category of “earned”, so there is no need to worry about any\nimplications surrounding what it constitutes.\nSo, based on the ERA of pitchers who pitched enough innings to\nqualify for MLB Awards (1 IP per team game played), Jacob DeGrom had the\nbest ERA of any pitcher. Below is the histogram of ERA over the course\nof the past 5 seasons, and you can see that he sets the edge as the\nlowest ERA value present on this graph. Something that I found\nparticularly interesting was that ERA appears to be normally\ndistributed; this is not something I had ever considered or would’ve\neven thought.\nAlso worth noting is the fact that the 5 year threshold was\narbitrarily chosen; nothing wacky happened in that 6th year to\ninvalidate these findings.\n\n\n\nSo to answer the question of where the Mets being the Mets comes into\nquestion here comes from what came of such an extraordinary season by a\npitcher. He let up the fewest amount of runs by any pitcher that year,\nso surely he must have had a dominant record, right? No. Despite doing\neverything he possibly could’ve DeGrom had a winning percentage of only\n55% in games that he started. This is astronomically low for the quality\nof pitching he produced. Again, how could this be possible? Sure, the\nMets were bad that year and failed to miss the playoffs, but they\nweren’t this bad to warrant these kind of results.\nBefore I show you the scatterplot of all pitcher winning percents\nagainst their ERA, let’s try and figure out why DeGrom underpreformed so\nheavily in the win column. Even in circumstances where he was lights\nout, he can’t record a win in starts where the Mets failed to give him\nany run support. Let’s take a look at how the Mets offense preformed in\ngames started by DeGrom vs all other games in the 2018 season. The\nresults describe the nightmare scenario we just depicted for an entire\nseason:\n\n\n\nIn games that DeGrom started, the offense clearly preformed\nworse.\nI’d like to say, mainly for anyone unfamiliar with the concept of\npitchers and them recording wins, is that it doesn’t mean as much today\nas in the past to have a poor win percent in the eyes of baseball\nanalysts. The era of advanced stats has allowed us to look at pitcher\nwins as just a piece to the puzzle rather than the full solution to how\ngood someone was that year. This is best evidenced by the fact that\nJacob DeGrom won the 2018 Cy Young Award, which is voted on by baseball\nmedia members as the best individual pitcher that year, despite having a\nrecord no where near the top of the league. This is all great for\nDeGrom, but the losses still count towards the 2018 Mets record, and\nplayed a major role in the lack of their success that season.\nI mentioned earlier how a lot of pitching stats, some more involved\nthan others, are all either loosely or directly related to each other.\nThere is no stat directly related to win percent, but there are quite\nalot heavily related to ERA. Let’s take a look at the correlation matrix\nof some of baseball’s top pitching statistics and see if the quality of\na pitcher has any indication on how many games they win or other\nperipheral measures of their success.\n\n\n\nLet’s break down some terms you may be unfamiliar with:\nFIP - “Fielding Independent Pitching” is essentially another way to\ncalculate a pitcher’s individual impact on his team, but is distinct\nfrom ERA in that it is more robust and places heavier weight on events\ncompletely within the pitchers control such as Home Runs and\nStrikeouts.\nERA Plus - Identical in nature to WRC+ we discussed earlier, expect\nnow in relation to pitcher ERAs.\nWHIP - “Walks, Hits, Innings Pitched” is a measure of how many\nrunners a pitcher allows per inning. Naturally, the lower this number is\nthe better.\nAny per 9 stats indicate the number of said stat the pitcher allows\nevery 9 innings of work; this is done as a baseline which we can compare\nplayers across\nNow that we have a good idea of what we’re looking at, we can see\nthat a lot of these indicators are strongly correlated, and all of which\nare moderately strong with win percent, the highest of which is just\nplain ERA, which makes sense. The more runs you allow, the less games\nyou will win. This holds true over any other measure, whether they be\nwalks or singles or any other negative stat.\nI think this chart is very interesting and delves into the beauty of\nbaseball; any stat on it’s own isn’t really worth anything but we can\ncheck its accuracy by comparing them to other closely related stats and\nget a better picture of an individual player.\nA lot of these correlation values are obvious to anyone who is\nfamiliar with these terms and how they are calculated because they are\nall based off each other: of course ERA and ERA+ have an extremely high\ncorrelation coefficient, and the same can be said with walks allowed per\nnine and WHIP. One that is not dependent on each other but is\nexceptionally high is WHIP with ERA. They make sense when you think\nabout it, as more base runners allowed will lead to more runs allowed,\nbut the link is stronger than I initially imagined.\nAll of this is to show and say that the failures of DeGrom in the\n2018 season should not represent anything close to a norm. He was an\nexceptional pitcher in 2018 and every possible pitching metric backs\nthat claim up. The fact that he only won 10 games in a season in which\nhe started 34 games (missing number in win/loss column represent no\ndecisions, which are games in which DeGrom left the game tied) is just\ntragic. Of all the graphs I made for this project, I found this one to\nbe the most comical; I’m sure you can figure out where DeGrom is listed\non this scatter plot of ERA against win percent.\n\n\n\nAnd just for the sake of it, let’s see what this would look like if\nwe remove DeGrom from this 5 year analysis\n\n\n\nThese two events represent some of the most improbable events in the\nhistory of baseball, and the fact that they happened within a 3 year\nspan to the same team is what is so beautiful and horrifying about the\ngame of baseball.\nI hope you enjoyed this\nexhibition\n\n\n\n",
